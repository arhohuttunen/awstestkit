== Overview

AWS TestKit provides a set of JUnit 5 extensions to make testing with AWS SDK easier. AWS TestKit works with service mocks provided by tools like https://github.com/localstack/localstack[LocalStack], https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.html[DynamoDB Local], or even real AWS services.

Only https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/home.html[AWS SDK for Java 2.x] is supported. Version 1.x will not be supported.

Currently, the following services are supported:

- CloudFormation
- DynamoDB
- Firehose
- Kinesis
- KMS
- S3
- SecretsManager
- SES
- SNS
- SQS
